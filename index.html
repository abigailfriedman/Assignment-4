        <h2 id="SYNOPSIS">Synopsis</h2>
        <p>Lemml, the stage manager, introduces the troupe of actors and musicians who will be telling the story of a play that changed his life, playing many different parts in a retelling interspersed with songs.</P>

        <p>In 1906, Polish-Jewish playwright Sholem Asch writes a play in Yiddish, The God of Vengeance, which concerns the love between a prostitute (Manke) and the daughter of the brothel's owner (Rifkele). His wife, Madje, is impressed. He holds the reading of the play in a local salon and receives mixed reactions from the participants; some are appalled by the lesbian storyline and the throwing of a Torah across the room. Some also worry it perpetuates anti-Semitism because it deals with prostitutes. Asche's only support comes from Lemml, a naive young tailor, who is moved to tears by the play. The play is eventually produced in Berlin with Lemml as stage manager, and starring the famous actor Rudolph Schildkraut. The play is successful throughout Europe and eventually heads to New York, where it has success in the original Yiddish.</p>

        <p>However, the play then seeks a more commercial run, prompting an English translation. The actresses playing Rifkele and Manke, Reina and Dine, are in a romantic relationship offstage as well as on, but their relationship is tested when Reina is fired due to her problems learning English and is replaced by an inexperienced American actress. The play is transferred to Broadway, but Dine and Lemml are outraged when the producer alters the play, removing the love between the two women and suggesting instead that Manke seduces Rifkele to also become a prostitute. Asche returns from a visit to Europe, where he witnesses the rise of anti-Semitism, leaving him in a deep depression. He seeks counseling and becomes a recluse in his Staten Island home. In 1923, the play premieres on Broadway, but the entire cast is arrested for obscenity due to the content of the play. Asch is convinced this is an antisemitic plot, but the charges are revealed to have been organized by an American Rabbi scandalized by the play. Reina and Dine reconcile.</p>

        <p>Asch, still depressed, refuses to testify in the actors' obscenity trial, ashamed that he approved changes to his play. He later reveals that he did not understand English well enough to know what the changes were. The actors are found guilty, and a heartbroken Lemml returns to Europe, taking the play's Yiddish manuscript with him. Asche remains in America and begins to receive letters from friends as they attempt to escape the Holocaust. In 1943, Lemml leads a tiny, starving troupe of actors in a performance of the play's second act in a tiny attic in the Lodz Ghetto. The performance is interrupted by the arrival of the Nazis. In his last moments, before the troupe is presumably executed, Lemml slips into a fantasy that Manke and Rifkele have escaped.</p>

        <p>In 1952, Asche and Madje are packing up their house in Staten Island to relocate to England since Asche is being persecuted by the House Unamerican Activities Committee. A young Jewish-American theater student (played by the same actor who played Asche as a young man) visits Asche to receive permission to have a new translation of the God of Vengeance performed by his theatre group at Yale. Asche refuses, traumatized by the news of the Holocaust and convinced the play's time is done, but the young man refuses to accept defeat and promises to one day produce the play. As Asche stands in his empty living room, he sees a vision of Manke and Rifkele falling in love as they dance in the rain (this is not the first time this scene is acted out, but is the first time actual water is used for it).</P>

          <p>The play received positive reviews. In his review of the Broadway production for The New York Times, Ben Brantley said of the play "Indecent is, above all, decent, in the most complete sense of the word. It is virtuous, sturdily assembled, informative and brimming with good faith. The territory it covers in its one hour and 45 minutes is immense." In her review for Newsday, Linda Winer asked "Has there ever been anything quite like Indecent, a play that touches — I mean deeply touches — so much rich emotion about history and the theater, anti-Semitism, homophobia, censorship, world wars, red-baiting and, oh, yes, joyful human passion?... It’s a gripping and entertaining show with laughter and tears and a real rainstorm in which two women from the marvelous 10-member cast re-enact what, in 1921, had been the first lesbian kiss on an American stage."</p>

          <p>Frank Rizzo, in his review of the Yale Rep production for the Hartford Courant wrote: "But at its heart it is the story of the transformative pull of art: Taichman's lyrical and image-rich direction, David Dorf's mesmerizing choreography and the atmospheric-setting music composed by Gutkin and Halva all add up to a compelling world of theatrical storytelling."</p>
